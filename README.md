# Notification
# Indigo notification plugin
This plugin for Indigo home automation software from Perceptive Automation (http://www.indigodomo.com) will allow you to send the following notification types:
- E-mail
- Push notification (Growl)
- Notification to variable
- Indigo server log
- Plugin separate log files (formatted as detailed csv files for viewing in Excel)
- Speech notifications

What makes it special is that you can very precisely set how to deliver different types of notifications based on presence and time since last notification.

For example, deliver push notifications to those present and e-mail to those who are not
You may also for example choose to have the speech announcement only if there are people present

When it comes to frequency, let's say you have a periodic check that runs every hour (check battery status for example). You would like to receive the notification as soon as possible, but you wouldn't like to receive the notification every hours.
Configurable frequencies are: hourly, 12 hourly, daily, weekly, monthly

The plugin is built so that you spend some time setting up "contact" information for the persons in your home and your categories/types of notification. Then the configuration to each notification is minimal and the important options like e-mail addresses etc. can be changed in only one 'central' place.
